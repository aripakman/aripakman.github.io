I am a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [IEM Department](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/engn/iem/) at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. 
I work on theoretical and applied probabilistic machine learning. 

 


<!--- 
I am looking for highly motivated MSc and PhD students with a background in physics, computer science and related fields.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
